                  <p>Juggling school, career, marriage and parenting can make taking care of yourself an item that's moved to the bottom of your to-do list. 
                      But it's crucial you make time to do the things that will have a big impact on your health later in life.</p>
                  <p>If you're able to reach middle age with low cholesterol, ideal blood pressure, an optimal weight, not smoking and not diabetic, you'll 
                      be less likely to ever develop chronic diseases. Whether you live free of chronic diseases after the age of 50 really depends on the 
                      actions you take now.</p>

                    <p>We also recommend using a food diary to track calories, a pedometer to measure your activity level and regular medical exams. Caring for ourselves has a ripple effect.
