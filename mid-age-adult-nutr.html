            <h1>Nutrition for Middle-Aged Adults</h1>
            <br>
            <p1>The metabolic rate that allowed you to burn through super-size burritos in your 20s is slowing�dropping by 1 percent every 4 years. And even if the number on your scale isn't rising, it's likely you're getting fatter. Scientists found that men who managed to maintain their weight for 40 years still gained 3 pounds of fat each decade�while losing 3 pounds of muscle.</p1>
            <br>
            <h3>The likely reason:</h3>
            After you pass 30, your testosterone levels decrease by up to 1 percent a year. This means it becomes harder for you to build�or even maintain�metabolism-boosting muscle. (See the connection?) Another side effect: By 40, more than half of men develop some degree of erectile dysfunction.
            <br>
            But sagging testosterone levels aren't your only health hazard. Starting at age 30, your systolic blood pressure rises 4 points per decade, and joint degeneration begins to occur.
            <br>
            Here's how to turn back your biological clock�and keep midlife years in front of you.
            <br>
            <h3>Corroding Joints</h3>
            Even though arthritis doesn't usually set in until your 50s, the damage that causes it is happening now.
            <br>
            <h3>The fix:</h3> <br>
            Eat three 6-ounce servings of cold-water fish weekly. Specifically, have salmon, mackerel, trout, halibut, or white tuna�each packs more than 1,000 mg of fish oil. A U.K. study found that regularly consuming this amount of fish oil appeared to halt cartilage-eating enzymes in 86 percent of people who are facing joint-replacement surgery. Fish oil slows down cartilage degeneration and reduces factors that cause inflammation, says lead researcher Bruce Caterson, Ph.D.
            <br>
            <h3>Rising Blood Pressure:</h3> <br>
            Some men are always close to their boiling points. And new research from the Netherlands may explain why. The scientists discovered that besides the obvious factors�obesity, lack of physical activity, and high salt consumption�diets containing too little potassium were the primary cause of hypertension. In their analysis, the scientists used 3,500 mg daily as the cutoff for defining a low potassium intake. The average intake for a man in his 30s? Only 3,100 mg.
            
            <h3>The fix:</h3> <br>
            Add � cup of beans, a banana, or a handful of raisins to your daily diet. Each will increase your potassium intake by about 400 mg a day, boosting you above that 3,500 mg benchmark.
