            <h1>Suggested food eating habits for Teenage Boys</h1>

            <p1>When at school or studying, your brain needs extra energy. Eating healthy foods is also linked to better concentration. Here are some tips for eating healthier when studying and during exams. </p1>
            <br>
            <h2> Eating for Study </h2>
            <p2> - Eat small frequent meals. </p2>
            <br>
            <p3>- Easy and convenient nutritious meals include: frozen dinners, tinned soups, peanut-butter sandwiches, breakfast cereal, cheese sandwiches, tuna or chicken and salad sandwiches, baked beans or eggs on toast.</p3>
            <br>
            <p4>- Snack foods like chips and lollies can cause you to feel grumpy, irritable and low in energy. That�s not what you want while you are studying. Try healthier snacks such as yoghurt, nuts, dried fruit, fresh fruit, plain popcorn or vegie sticks with dip.</p4>
            <br>
            <p5>- People use caffeine for a �pick me up� to feel more awake or alert. Too much caffeine from coffee, tea, cola and energy drinks can disrupt your sleeping patterns, send your heart racing, make it difficult to focus and/or cause nervousness in some people. Try sticking to one or two cups of coffee or tea a day, or try decaffeinated coffee or herbal teas as an alternative. Enjoy cola or energy drinks only occasionally as they have too much sugar and little nutritional benefit.</p5>
            <br>
            <p6> - Eat only when you are hungry. Be aware of your hunger signals, like stomach pangs, grumbling guts, dry mouth etc. If you need a study break and do not have hunger pangs, have a drink of water or go for a walk. </p6> 
            <br>
            <p7> - Regular exercise helps to improve your blood circulation, which keeps oxygen and nutrients flowing to your body and brain helping you to concentrate. </p7>
            <br>
            <p8>Drink plenty of water. When you are dehydrated you can feel tired.</p8>
            <br>
