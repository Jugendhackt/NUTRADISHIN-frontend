            <h1>Nutrition for Infants</h1>
            <p> Infancy is the period in a child�s life between birth and 12 months of age. Inadequate nutrition during infancy can result in stunted growth, low body weight, delayed cognitive and physical development and even death. Ensuring your infant gets proper nutrition will help him reach his full potential for cognitive, physical and emotional development. </p>
            
            <h2> Upto 6 months </h2>
            <p> We recommend infants consume breast milk only for the first six months of life, and breast milk with complementary foods from 6 to 12 months of age. Mothers who choose not to, or are unable to, breastfeed can offer their baby infant formula in place of breast milk. Infants from 0 to 6 months old should drink breast milk or infant formula every few hours, or on demand, to help meet nutritional requirements. </p>
            
            <h2> First Foods </h2>
            <p>At about 6 months of age, your baby is likely ready to start eating solid foods. The first solid food to offer your infant is iron-fortified infant rice cereal with infant formula or breast milk, mixed to a thin consistency. Initially offer 1 to 2 tablespoons of the rice cereal two times per day and increase to three or four times per day.
            
            After your baby has mastered eating rice cereal, you can offer him other types of iron-fortified infant cereals; however breast milk or infant formula is still his main source of nutrition.</p>
            
            <h2> Second Foods </h2>
            <p> When your baby has mastered cereals, he is probably ready to start strained fruits and vegetables. Many babies start eating fruits and veggies at between 6 and 8 months of age. Offer 2 to 3 tablespoons about 4 times per day. 
            We recommend you to introduce one new food every week, to help recognize possible food allergies or intolerances. 
            Whole-milk baby yogurt is a high-protein option to try between 6 and 12 months of age. Breast milk or infant formula is still your infant�s main source of nutrition during this time.<p>
            
            <h2> Transitional Food </h2>
            <p> Around 8 months of age, your infant is probably ready to start eating iron-rich strained meats in addition to iron-fortified infant cereals, strained fruits and vegetables, whole-milk baby yogurt and infant formula or breast milk. Between the ages of 8 and 12 months, offer your infant breast milk or infant formula three to four times per day. You may also gradually start offering your infant soft finger foods such as egg yolks, bananas, soft meat sticks, soft cheese, tofu and oat ring cereal. Avoid giving your infant cow�s milk until he reaches 1 year of age. </p>
            
            <h2> DO's DON'Ts for Infant's eating habits </h2>
            
            <h3> DOs: </h3>
            <p>
            -Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for preparing bottles before filling them with formula or milk. Observe "use-by" dates on formula cans.</p>
            <p>
            -Check to see that the safety button on the lid of commercial baby-food jars is down. If the jar lid doesn't "pop" when opened, don't use the product. Discard any jars with chipped glass or rusty lids.</p>
            <p>
            -Use detergent and hot water to wash all blenders, food processors, and utensils (including the can opener) that come in contact with a baby's foods. Rinse well with hot water after washing. </p>
            <p>
            -Transport bottles and food in an insulated cooler when traveling with the baby. Perishable items (milk, formula, or food) left out of the refrigerator or without a cold source for more than two hours should not be used. Cold temperatures keep most harmful bacteria from multiplying. </p>
            
            
            <h3> DON'Ts:</h3>
            <p>
            -Don't make more formula than you will need. Formula can become contaminated during preparation. If a large quantity of formula is prepared and not properly refrigerated, bacteria can multiply to very large numbers. The more bacteria there are, the greater the chances for foodborne illness. Preparing formula in smaller quantities on an as-needed basis greatly reduces the possibility of contamination. If using powder, reconstitute immediately before feeding. If using liquid concentrates or ready-to-feed products, follow label instructions provided by the manufacturer. </p>
            
            <p>
            -Don't put a bottle back in the refrigerator if the baby doesn't finish it. Harmful bacteria from a baby's mouth can be introduced into the bottle during feeding; they can grow and multiply even after refrigeration (some bacteria can grow at refrigerator temperatures) and reheating. The temperature that's needed to kill harmful bacteria is extremely high for consumption by a baby. Also, it's not a good idea to repeatedly reheat formula because lots of nutrients can be lost. </p>
            
            <p>
            -Don't feed a baby from a jar of baby food and then put it in the refrigerator. Saliva on the spoon may contaminate the remaining food. Instead, put a serving size on a dish. Refrigerate the food remaining in the jar. Throw away the food in the serving dish that's not eaten. <p/12>
            
            
            <p>
            -Don't use honey as a sweetener to entice babies to drink water from a bottle. Honey isn't safe for children less than a year old. It can contain the Clostridium botulinum organism that could cause serious illness or death. </p>
            
            <p>
            -Don't leave formula out at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Harmful bacteria can grow rapidly in food at room temperature. Discard formula that's been left out for more than two hours.</p>
            
            <p>
            -Don't place dirty diapers in the same bag with bottles or food. Harmful bacteria from a dirty diaper can spread to baby's food. </p>
