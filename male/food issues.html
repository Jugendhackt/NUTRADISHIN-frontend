            <h1> Health issues in Teenage boys </h1>
                <p1> It's another busy day for John. After a day of classes and an exhausting soccer practice, he now has half an hour of free time to grab some dinner before play rehearsal. He orders a large pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese and gobbles it down with time to spare.</p1>
                <br>
                <p2>As he walks into the theater for rehearsal, John starts to feel nauseated and he has a burning feeling in the back of his throat. John can't understand what's going on � he felt fine just a few minutes ago.</p2>
                <br>
                
                <h2>What Is Indigestion?</h2> <br>
                <p3>John has indigestion, a common digestive problem. Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia (pronounced: dis-PEP-see-ah), is just another name for an upset stomach. Indigestion usually happens when people eat too much or too fast, or certain foods don't agree with them. It might happen more often if you smoke, drink alcohol, are stressed out, or don't get enough sleep.</p3>
                <br>
                <p4>Sometimes indigestion can be accompanied by heartburn. Despite its name though, heartburn actually has nothing to do with your heart. It's caused by stomach acid splashing up from the stomach and into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. This is called esophageal reflux, and it usually leaves a sour or bitter taste in the mouth.</p4>
                <br>
                <p5>Indigestion and heartburn are common problems for people of all ages � hence all those commercials for heartburn and indigestion medicines on TV. Some of the medicines you see advertised are OK for teens, but some of them are meant for adults.</p5>
                <br>
                <h2>What Causes Indigestion?</h2>
                <p6>You may be wondering how indigestion occurs in the first place. There are many potential causes � often it's just because a person eats too much or eats too fast, as mentioned before. But sometimes it can be due to smoking, drinking alcohol, or certain stomach problems, like gastritis (stomach inflammation) or an ulcer.</p6>
                
                <h2>What is Cystic Fibrosis? </h2>
                <p7>At lunch, Lindsay often gets bored with having the same old conversation with her friends:
                <br>
                "You're so lucky!"
                <br>
                "Yeah, I'd give anything to be able to eat as much as you do and be so skinny!"
                <br>
                "Cheeseburgers or mac and cheese every day � that would be great."</p7> <br>
                <p8>
                Lindsay is one of about 30,000 people living with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the United States, and she has to eat high-fat, high-calorie foods just to stay healthy. A lot of the time she just doesn't feel well enough to eat the foods most teens crave. And sometimes, when her schedule's really hectic, she'd love to just skip a meal like her friends do.</p8>
                <br>
                CF is a genetic disease that affects the body's epithelial cells, which are found in many places, including the sweat glands, the lungs, and the pancreas. An error in these cells causes problems with the balance of salt and water in the body. The body responds by making thick mucus, which blocks the lungs and sometimes other ducts and passageways, causing infections and breathing problems.
                <br>
                This mucus can also keep the intestines from absorbing important nutrients like fat and vitamins from food, which means that teens with CF may be short and underweight for their age, and they may get sick a lot because their bodies can't fight infections well.
                <br>
                People with CF need extra calories and nutrients to help them fight infection and keep their lungs strong, particularly if they get sick with colds or the flu.
