            <h1> NUTRIENTS FOR MIDDLE AGED WOMEN </h1>
            <h2> VITAMINS AND MINERALS </h2>
            <p>
            <br><b>Vitamin C </b>
            Water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body. Any excess of these vitamins is flushed out of the body through urine, so you need to obtain a steady supply through your diet. Water-soluble vitamins include vitamin C and the vitamin B-complex group. Vitamin C aids in wound healing, strengthens blood vessels, improves the function of the immune system, increases the absorption of iron and is involved with bone and tooth formation. Women need 75 milligrams of vitamin C per day.</br>
            <br> </b>Vitamin B-Complex</b>
            The vitamin B-complex group consists of eight water-soluble vitamins: thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-6, folate, vitamin B-12, biotin and pantothenic acid. The B vitamins help the body get energy from food, aid the nervous system, help with red blood cell formation and aid in maintaining normal appetite, vision and skin. Women need 1.1 milligrams per day of thiamin, 1.1 milligrams per day of riboflavin, 14 milligrams of niacin, 1.3 milligrams of vitamin B-6, 400 micrograms of folate, 2.4 micrograms of vitamin B-12, 30 micrograms of biotin and 5 micrograms of pantothenic acid.</br>
            <br><b>Vitamins A and D</b>
            Fat-soluble vitamins dissolve in fat prior to being absorbed by the body. When you consume too much of these vitamins, they are stored in the liver. Too much of these vitamins can lead to toxicity and may be dangerous to your health. The fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E and K. Vitamin A has an important role in bone and tooth development, reproduction, cell division and immune system function. Women need 700 micrograms of vitamin A per day. Vitamin D aids in the development of bones and teeth and supports cell growth and the immune system. Women need 15 micrograms of vitamin D per day.</br>
            <br><b>Vitamins E and K </b>
            Vitamins E and K are also fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant in the body and protects vitamins A and C, blood cells and fatty acids from being destroyed. Women need 15 micrograms of vitamin E per day. Vitamin K is naturally produced in the gut by bacteria and aids in blood clotting. Ninety micrograms of vitamin K is considered an adequate Intake for women.</br>
            <br><b>Calcium, Iron and Iodine</b>
            Calcium is used to maintain bones and tooth mass. It also aids in moving muscles and sending messages from the brain to the rest of the body. Women need 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day. Iron transports oxygen throughout the body and aids in cell growth. Too little iron can lead to fatigue and decreased immunity. Women who still get their menstrual cycle need 18 milligrams of iron per day. Women who no longer have a menstrual cycle only need 8 milligrams of iron daily. Iodine is a mineral that helps make thyroid hormones, which control the bodyï¿½s metabolism. Women need 150 micrograms of iodine per day.</br>
            <br><b>Magnesium, Selenium and Zinc</b>
            Magnesium is needed to produce energy in the body. It also transports calcium throughout the body, is needed for muscle contraction and supports normal heart rhythm. Women need 320 milligrams of magnesium per day. Selenium is a mineral involved in reproduction, creation of DNA and protection of the body from infection. Women need 55 micrograms of selenium per day. Zinc helps the immune system by fighting off bacteria and viruses. It also ensures that you smell and taste things properly. Women need 8 micrograms of zinc per day.</br>
