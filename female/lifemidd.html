            <h1>FOOD AND LIFESTYLE </h1>
            <p>
            <br><b> WEIGHT MANAGEMENT</b>Women over 40 may begin to experience �middle-aged spread� or hard-to-lose belly fat, which has links to heart disease and type 2 diabetes. You may try various fad diets, but the best plan for losing weight safely is to focus on a diet of whole, fresh foods. Choose lean proteins, such as poultry, beans, legumes, low-fat dairy and seeds. Opt for healthy carbohydrates, such as whole grains and vegetables, which are high in fiber to keep you full between meals. Stick with unsaturated fats from fish, olive oil, avocados and nuts. Highly processed and refined food products, such as white bread, chips, baked goods and frozen dinners, tend to be loaded with excess fat, sugar or sodium, with few beneficial nutrients.
            </br>
            <br> </b>SKIN HEALTH</b>When little lines and wrinkles start appearing, you have options other than Botox and plastic surgery. A healthy diet full of a wide range of colorful fruits and vegetables can help keep your skin looking firm and give you a radiant, natural glow. Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant that fights molecules called free radicals, which can cause oxidative damage to your skin. Some of the best food sources are broccoli, kiwi, citrus fruits, bell peppers, papaya, parsley and strawberries. Beta-carotene can lessen skin damage from ultraviolet rays and slow the breakdown of collagen, a protein in the skin. Eat brightly colored orange and yellow fruits and veggies and lots of leafy greens to obtain this nutrient.
            </br>
            <br><b>BONE SUPPORT</b>Your bones lose density over time, especially after menopause. Women over 40 should get plenty of the nutrients that keep bones strong over the course of their lives. Calcium, from foods such as milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, leafy greens, clams, oysters, broccoli and almonds, works with vitamin D to support bone health. Vitamin D is found in fish, such as herring, tuna and cod, and in some fortified foods; your body also can synthesize it after direct exposure to sunlight. Boron is another mineral that supports your bone health; good sources include dried fruit, almonds and peanuts. Your doctor may order a bone density scan around age 40 to see if you need supplementation to ward off bone loss, which can result in osteoporosis later.
            </br>
            <br><b>HEART HEALTH </b></br>When you reach 40, you need to take special care of your heart with diet and exercise. Heart disease is the leading cause of death among women, notes the National Institutes of Health. Among the best nutrients for heart health are omega-3 fatty acids, found especially in fatty, cold-water fish, such as salmon, sardines and herring. Plant-based omega-3s are found in flaxseeds and walnuts. Combine healthy servings of these foods with fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and reduce your consumption of unhealthy saturated fats contained in red meat and full-fat dairy. If your cholesterol is already high, limit your consumption of eggs to four or fewer a week, or switch to egg whites which have none of the dietary cholesterol that can clog your arteries.
