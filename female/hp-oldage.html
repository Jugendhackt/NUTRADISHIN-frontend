        <p>
            As an individual reaches a certain age, health problems associated with old age like hearing & eyesight loss start to happen. 
            Macular degeneration, Glaucoma, Cataracts, and Blindness are some of the common eye-related problems. Hundreds of millions of 
            people suffer from age-related eye problems.
            Experts say that people who smoke cigarettes are at a higher risk of macular degeneration. Glaucoma is also a leading cause of 
            vision loss & blindness. Include foods with high antioxidant content in your diet and consume vitamins for eye health. These 
            steps can help you prevent eye problems. Consult your physician if you have Glaucoma.
            Hearing aids can be used by elderly people aged over 65 but the Hearing loss cannot be cured. The number of hearing loss cases is 
            high from the age group between 45 to 65 and is one of the health problems faced by old age. Listening to high-frequency sounds 
            causes Hearing loss. Using earbuds with loud music can lead you to hear impairment. The simple remedy for deafness is to avoid 
            using earphones and listening to music with low volume.
