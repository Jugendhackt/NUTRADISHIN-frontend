            <h1> NUTRIENTS FOR YOUNG FEMALES </h1>
            <h2> calories </h2>
            <p1>Next to infancy, adolescence is a time of the most rapid growth for children. Eating enough calories is necessary to meet the needs of a fast-growing teen. Your individual calorie needs are based on your age, activity level and height. Most teenage girls need between 1,400 and 2,400 calories a day. If you are 13 years old and not very active, you probably need around 1,400 calories a day. If you are a 17-year-old athlete, you probably need closer to 2,400 calories a day. Choose foods that not only have calories, but other nutrients as well. The Centers for Disease Control report that teenage girls drink an average of 14 ounces of regular soda a day but only 6 ounces of milk. Soda and milk have close to the same amount of calories but milk contains more nutrients. </p1>
            <h2> carbohydrates, fats and proteins </h2>
            <p2> 
            Eating a variety of foods will ensure that you get all the nutrients you need. About half of your calories should come from carbohydrate foods including whole grains, milk, fruits and some vegetables. Ten to 30 percent of your calories should come from protein foods such as meat, poultry, fish, nuts and eggs. Limit your fat intake to 25 to 35 percent of your calories. Mono- and polyunsaturated fats, such as those found in avocados, oils and soft margarines are healthier than saturated or trans-fats. Limit your saturated and trans-fat intake to less than 10 percent of your calories. Saturated and trans-fats are found in high-fat meats such as bacon, hot dogs and bologna; butter; and fried foods.
            Vitamins
            
            </p2>
            <h2> minerals </h2>
            <p3>
            The Institute of Medicine lists recommended dietary allowances, or RDAs, for 14 vitamins. One vitamin that is particularly important for teenage girls is folate. The RDA for folate is 400 micrograms per day. Folate helps in protein metabolism, cell growth and division and forms red blood cells. All of these occur quickly as you grow during your teenage years. Folate is also necessary to prevent certain birth defects during your child-bearing years. You can find folate mostly in fruits and vegetables.

            <h2> vitamins </h2>
            <p4>
            The Institute of Medicine lists RDAs for 15 minerals or elements. Iron, calcium and zinc are especially important for teenage girls. As you start menstruating you lose blood, which causes a decrease in your iron levels. Iron helps transport oxygen to cells in your body. Without it, you feel tired, can�t concentrate and the cells in your body don�t function as they should. The RDA for iron is 15 milligrams per day for teenage girls. Iron is found mostly in meat and poultry, leafy green vegetables and enriched cereals, breads and grains.
            Calcium helps build strong bones. As you grow, your bones get longer and need more calcium. The RDA for calcium is 1,300 milligrams a day. Calcium is found in dairy products and is added to some juices.
            Zinc helps your immune system, builds protein and is necessary for proper growth and development. The RDA for zinc is 9 milligrams per day. Most Americans get plenty of zinc in their diet. It can be found in meats, poultry, enriched cereal, cashews, cheese and milk.
