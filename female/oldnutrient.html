			<h1>NUTRIENTS FOR OLD AGE PEOPLE EATING HABITS </h1>
			<p1>
			<h2> CALORIES </h2><br>The amount of calories you need depends on how physically active you are. The USDA defines a sedentary lifestyle as one in which you are limited to the activities of daily living. If you walk briskly for more than 3 miles a day you are considered active. You may need more or fewer calories than whatï¿½s recommended if you are unable to maintain a healthy weight.</br>
			<br>Men: A sedentary male over the age of 70 requires around 2,000 calories. Consume about 2,600 calories a day if you are active.</br>
			<br>Women: Eat between 1,600 to 2,000 calories daily if you are a sedentary to active female older than 70 years.</br>
			
			</p1>
			<p2> </h2> FIBRES </h2>Healthy men over 70 should aim for 56 grams of protein a day from meat, chicken, fish, beans and dairy products. Shoot for 46 grams of protein if you are a female of the same age.
			</p2>
			<p3><h2>PROTEINS </h2>Eat a variety of fruit, vegetables and whole grains to get the recommended 28 grams of fiber daily for an adult male over 70. If you are female, strive for 22 grams of fiber a day.
			</p3>
			<p4><h2> VITAMINS AND MINERALS </h2>Some of your micronutrient needs increase as you age. Eating a variety of whole foods (fortified grains, quality protein, fruits and vegetables) each day will help you meet your vitamin and mineral needs.
			Men and women should both strive for 600 international units of vitamin D from fish, egg yolks, fortified foods and supplements every day.
			The amount of stomach acid you produce decreases with age or certain medications. This may put you at risk for vitamin B-12 deficiency and symptoms like depression and fatigue. Supplements and fortified foods, such as orange juice, milk and yogurt are usually well-absorbed by your body. Everyone should get 2.4 micrograms of vitamin B-12 daily.
			The amount of vitamin B-6 you need increases as you get older. You need 1.7 milligrams daily if you are male and 1.5 milligrams if you are female. Eat chicken, fish, potatoes and fruit to meet your vitamin B-6 needs.

			<p5><h2>DIET AND FEEDING PLAN</h2>
			Diet and Feeding Pattern
			Since good nutrition is of immense significance during old age, care should be taken that the diets of elderly are nutritionally adequate and well balanced. With the advancement of age, the energy needs are reduced as a result the total quantum of food intake intake is lowered while the requirement of most of the other nutrients remains unaltered. Therefore, it becomes all the more important to provide adequate amounts of all the nutrients within the decreased energy levels. 
			Few factors to be kept in mind while planning balanced meals for the elderly
			<ul>
				<li>Intake of energy rich foods like sweets, fried or high fat foods, cereals and starches needs to be reduced while liberal amounts of milk and milk products, fresh fruits, vegetables particularly green leafy vegetables, should be included to meet the vitamin and mineral needs.</li>
				<li>An adequate intake of calcium, in particular, should be ensured to compensate for its losses due to gradual demineralization of bones  associated with aging.</li>
				<li>Since sufficient exposure to sunlight is essential to meet the body's needs for vitamin D, in case of elderly individuals confined to bed, suppliments of this vitamin need to be provided.</li>
				<li>Food rich in fats, especially saturated fats, should be avoided and instead oils containing high levels of poly unsaturated fatty acids such as sunflower oils, soyabean oil etc. should be used to prevent and control the condition of hypertension and other cardio-vascular diseases.</li>
				<li>Intake of simple sugars, should be reduced as these provide only empty calories.</li>
				<li>Dietary fibre has a beneficial effect in various conditions associated with aging such as constipation, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, adequate amount of food rich in dietary fibre should be included in the diet.</li>
				<li>With the advancement of age, the capacity to digest and tolerate large meals often decreases. Therefore, the quantity of food given at a time needs to be decreased. If required number of meals can be increased as per the individual's tolerance</li>
				<li>Due to the loss of teeth particularly if dentures are not used, modifications in consistency needs to be done. The diet should be soft, well cooked and should include foods that need little or no mastication such as milk and milk products, soft cooked eggs, tender meats, gruels, soft cooked vegetables, grated salads, fruit juices, soft fruits like banana or stewed fruits.</li>
				<li>The food for the elderly should be colourful, attractive and tasty and should be served in pleasant surroundings so as to arouse their appetite and interest in the food
						Apart from the diet, the elderly are advised to continue with their physical activity and light exercises to keep fit and prevent the occurrence of diseases like arthritis, gout and obesity. Regular or periodic health checkups and weight monitoring also helps in physical fitness and early detection of complications, if any</li>
			</ul> 
			<p6>Even at a younger age, a lack of physical activity and regular exercise, as well as a poor diet can contribute toward high blood pressure, heart disease and heart attacks, a lack of sexual activity, and a poor health-related quality of life.
			Therefore, for us to really appreciate the value of a healthy lifestyle as older adults, it is important that we acknowledge the changes that occur within us as we age. When you are aware of the changes, then they will not surprise you.
			These life changes are both physical and emotional. Emotionally, we struggle with the loss of loved ones, our careers, and our independence. Physically, our bodies are not as vibrant as when we were younger.
			Despite these changes, a quality and fulfilling life is still within our reach. In this article, we look at the ways to live our life during our hay days by maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
