                <h2> EATING DISORDERS </h2>   

                <p>
                People with an eating disorder experience extreme disturbances in their eating behaviour and related thoughts and feelings. They have an overwhelming drive to be thin and a morbid fear of gaining weight and losing control over their eating. Eating disorders can cause serious physical and psychological problems. They are not a lifestyle choice.
                Eating disorders can be effectively treated and the earlier the treatment the better the recovery. Families and friends often need support and assistance too, and are involved in the treatment process.
                A physical health check is essential to rule out possible medical complications that can arise from the condition. It is also very important to have the right information about your diet and about healthy eating, as there is plenty of wrong or misunderstood information about food and nutrition out there.
                Talking with a professional counsellor is necessary to help change your thoughts, feelings and behaviours related to the eating disorder, and to help deal with the stressful things that might be happening in your life, like relationship problems, school issues and other things.
                If you have complications like severe depression or anxiety, medications may be useful.

                <h2> PREVENTING ACNES </h2>
                <p> 
                    No single food causes acne, but what you eat may influence acne. For some teenagers, foods like chocolate or greasy takeaways can have an effect on their skin. As a general rule to prevent acne, try to eat fewer processed foods, and eat and drink healthily.
                </p>
                
                <h2> MENTAL HEALTH </h2>
                <p>
                    Women are more likely to show signs of depression and anxiety than men are. Depression is the most common women's mental health problem,5 and more women than men are diagnosed with depression each year.
